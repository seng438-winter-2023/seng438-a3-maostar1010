# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we will be running coverage tests on the test suite developed in the previous lab. First, we will collect various coverage data such as line, branch, and method coverage. Eclipse and EclEmma will be used to collect the coverage information. Using this coverage information, we will use white box testing techniques to go back and refine the test suite in order to meet the minimum coverage requirements. To remain consistent with the previous lab, we will again be using JUnit 4 to write and run our software tests. 

# 2 Control-flow Coverage

To measure the control flow coverage we are using EclEmma. To calculate statement coverage we used EclEmma’s line counter. We used the branch counter to calculate branch coverage. Unfortunately, EclEmma does not support condition coverage, we attempted to use CodeCover but it did not work in the version of eclipse installed. We decided to use EclEmma’s method coverage as a third coverage metric.

## 2.1 Range

The coverage for the Range class is as follows:

| Class/Function        | Statement Coverage  | Branch Coverage | Method Coverage |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Range**             | **20.2%%**          | **13.4%**       | **34.8%**       |
| getCentralValue()     | 100%                | 100%            | 100%            |
| getLength()           | 40%                 | 50%             | 100%            |

| contains()            | 100%                | 75%             | 100%            |
| exapnd()              | 75%                 | 50%             | 100%            |

## 2.2 DataUtilities

The coverage for the DataUtilities class is as follows:

| Class/Function                      | Statement Coverage  | Branch Coverage | Method Coverage |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **DataUtilities**                   | **45.8%**           | **35.9%**       | **50%**         |

### 3.2 CalculateColumnTotal

#### 3.2.1 Def-use Sets
First we will outline the Def-use sets for each statement of CalculateColumnTotal

| 4         | int rowCount = data.getRowCount();              | def(4)={rowCount}, use(4)={data}        |
| 5         | for (int r = 0; r < rowCount; r++) {            | def(5)={r}, use(5)={rowCount, r}        |
| 6         | Number n = data.getValue(r, column);            | def(6)={n}, use(6)={data,r,column}      |
| 7         | if (n != null) {                                | def(7)={}, use(7)={n}                   |
| 8         | total += n.doubleValue();                       | def(8)={total}, use(8)={n}              |
| 9         | }                                               | def(9)={}, use(9)={}                    |

| 11        | for (int r2 = 0; r2 > rowCount; r2++) {         | def(11)={r2}, use(11)={rowCount, r2}    |
| 12        | Number n = data.getValue(r2, column);           | def(12)={n}, use(12)={data,r2, column}  |
| 13        | if (n != null) {                                | def(13)={}, use(13)={n}                 |

#### 3.2.2 Data-flow Graph
Using the def-use sets we will create the data flow graph so we can analyse the data-flow coverage.

<img src="media/data-flow-calculate.png" alt="data flow graph for calculateColumnTotal" width="360"/>

#### 3.2.3 DU pairs

Using the data-flow graph we can summarize the def-use pairs for each node.

| Variable (v)  | Defined in node (n) | dcu(v, n)     | dpu(v, n)                         |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| data          | 1                   | {1, 2, 4, 7}  | {}                                |
| column        | 1                   | {4, 7}        | {}                                |
| total         | 1                   | {5, 8, 9}     | {}                                |
| total         | 5                   | {5, 8, 9}     | {}                                |
| total         | 8                   | {8, 9}        | {}                                |
| rowCount      | 2                   | {}            | {(3, 4), (3, 6), (6, 7), (6, 9)}  |
| r             | 3                   | {3, 4}        | {(3, 4), (3, 6)}                  |
| n             | 4                   | {5}           | {(4, 5), (4, 3)}                  |
| r2            | 6                   | {6, 7}        | {(6, 7), (6, 9)}                  |
| n             | 7                   | {8}           | {(7, 8), (7, 6)}                  |

#### 3.2.4 Data-flow Coverage
First we will calculate $CU$ and $PU$:
	
  $$CU = 20$$
	
  $$PU = 12$$
  
Next, we will check for any infeasible test cases. If the predicate path (3, 4) from the variable rowCount defined at node 2 is followed then the predicate path (6, 7) cannot be followed. Hence the following DU pairs are not feasible:

| Variable (v)  | Defined in node (n) | dcu(v, n)     | dpu(v, n)                         |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| data          | 1                   | {7}           | {}                                |
| column        | 1                   | {7}           | {}                                |
| total         | 1                   | {8}           | {}                                |
| total         | 5                   | {8}           | {}                                |
| total         | 8                   | {8, 9}        |                                   |
| rowCount      | 2                   | {}            | {(6, 7)}                          |
| r2            | 6                   | {6, 7}        | {(6, 7)}                          |
| n             | 7                   | {8}           | {(7, 8), (7, 9)}                  |
 
From these we can calculate $CU_f$ and $PU_f$:
  
  $$CU_f=9$$
  
  $$PU_f= 4$$
  
Using our test cases we developed in assignment 2 we can check the DU-Pairs we are covering:

| Test Case # | data            | column  | dcu(v, n)                                                                                                             | dpu(v, n)                                                                                       |

From these test cases we can calculate $CU_c$ and $PU_C$:

  $$CU_c = 10$$
  
  $$PU_C = 8$$
  
Now we can calculate the data flow coverage:

  $$ au = {CU_c + PU_c \over (CU + PU) - (CU_f + PU_f)} * 100 = 94.7\\% $$

# 4 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

While we had achieved the minimum required coverage for the majority of methods, there were a few cases where we identified room for improvement.
To address this, we decided to use both structural and data flow coverage criteria. 
We specifically focused on areas where we could improve conditional coverage and, using our manual data flow coverage calculations, 
we designed additional tests to enhance this metric.

# 5 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

For calculateColumnTotal and CalculateRowTotal, we add a test case in each that improves the conditional coverage of each function. Using the data-flow graph
in the prior function we created a test case that passes in a zero-length data variable. This improves the data-flow coverage to 100% for each function by covering the total: {1, 9} du-pair.

## 6.1 Data Utilities

### 6.1.1 CalculateColumnTotal and CalculateRowTotal

Since there is unreachable code, it was not possible to meet the minimum test coverage. 
Specifically, the second for loop in each function is impossible to reach.

We were able to improve the conditional coverage by creating a unit test for each function that utilized a zero-length data variable.

### 6.1.2 GetCumulativePercentages

As with the prior tests it was not possible to reach the minimum test coverage due to the existence of unreachable code. However, we were able to reach minimum branch coverage.

### 6.1.3 GetNumberArray

We were able to reach 100% statement, branch, and condition coverage for both CreateNumberArray functions. We did not have to add any tests as our prior tests reached the minimum coverage for each metric.
